Living Room
This room has a strange atmosphere. It's dusty, not good for my allergies. There's a hallway leading south.

Fido was his name. It lacks personality. In any case, rest in peace, Fido.

What a strange house, there seems to be no stairs to go up. Further south there seems to be a trapdoor though.

It is partly destoyed. You can only read one entry. It reads: Day 998: Test subject dies after 10 days of infection, that works, however, it is pretty obvious that he was sick, he began shaking and loosing memory. There are still things to upgrade.

He left a prepared bag of popcorn in there. Maybe the owner will return soon. I might as well eat some while I can :P.

There is a trapdoor here. Seems to be used to dispose of trash. Maybe I can head EAST into the house from it.
